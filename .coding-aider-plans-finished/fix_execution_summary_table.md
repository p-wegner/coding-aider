# [Coding Aider Plan]

## Overview
This plan addresses an issue with the execution summary table in plan history files. Currently, the execution summary is not reliably created - it sometimes only appears on the second execution, and the markdown table may be missing the first entry while the commented data section includes it.

## Problem Description
The `PlanExecutionCostService` is responsible for tracking execution costs and creating history files with both a machine-readable commented section and a human-readable markdown table. However, there are inconsistencies in how the table is generated:

1. The table sometimes doesn't appear until the second execution
2. The first entry may be missing from the table while present in the commented data
3. The table generation logic may not be properly triggered when creating a new history file

## Goals
1. Ensure the execution summary table is always created on the first execution
2. Make sure all entries in the commented data section are included in the markdown table
3. Fix the table generation logic to be consistent and reliable
4. Improve the overall robustness of the history file creation and update process

## Implementation Details

### Fix Table Generation Logic
- Review and fix the `updateHumanReadableTable` and `updateHumanReadableTableWithEntries` methods
- Ensure table generation is properly called when creating a new history file
- Make sure all entries from the commented data section are included in the table

### Improve History File Creation
- Ensure the table is created immediately when a new history file is created
- Fix the logic for adding the first entry to both the commented section and the table
- Make the file creation process more robust

### Enhance Entry Parsing
- Improve the parsing of entries from the commented data section
- Ensure all entries are properly included when regenerating the table

## Additional Notes
- The issue appears to be in the `PlanExecutionCostService.kt` file
- The problem affects the user experience as cost information is not consistently displayed
- The fix should maintain backward compatibility with existing history files
