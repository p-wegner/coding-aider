[Coding Aider Plan]

## Overview
The image drag and drop functionality in the Coding-Aider plugin is not working properly. The current implementation in ImageAwareTransferHandler doesn't trigger when images are dragged into the input field. This needs to be fixed to provide a seamless image handling experience alongside the existing clipboard paste functionality.

## Problem Description
1. The drag and drop handlers in ImageAwareTransferHandler are not being triggered
2. Debug breakpoints in image handling methods are not hit
3. The current implementation may not properly register for drag and drop events
4. The transfer handler delegation chain might be broken

## Goals
1. Enable proper drag and drop functionality for images in the input dialog
2. Maintain existing clipboard paste functionality
3. Ensure proper event handling and delegation
4. Add proper debug logging for troubleshooting
5. Maintain consistent image handling between drag-drop and paste operations

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- Must preserve existing clipboard paste functionality
- Should handle both file-based images and direct image data
- Need to properly chain to delegate handler for non-image content
- Should support common image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF)
- Must integrate with existing image saving functionality
