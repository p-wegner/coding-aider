# [Coding Aider Plan] Auto Commit Integration

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of an automatic commit feature that integrates with the existing plugin-based edits and augmented prompt features. The goal is to create a cohesive workflow where the plugin can handle code changes and automatically commit them using commit messages extracted from the LLM's response.

## Problem Description
Currently, the plugin has several related features that work independently:
1. Plugin-based edits - Allows the plugin to parse and apply code changes from LLM responses
2. Augmented prompts - Structures LLM output with XML tags including commit message suggestions
3. Lenient edits - Processes multiple edit formats in a single response

However, these features are not well-integrated in the UI, and there's no automatic commit functionality that leverages the commit messages generated by the LLM.

## Goals
1. Reorganize the settings UI to group related features together for better clarity
2. Add a new setting to enable automatic commits after successful plugin-based edits
3. Implement functionality to extract commit messages from augmented LLM responses
4. Create a commit mechanism that triggers after successful plugin-based edits
5. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout the process

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- The automatic commit feature should only activate when:
  - Plugin-based edits are enabled
  - Automatic commits are enabled
  - At least one file was successfully modified
  - A valid commit message could be extracted from the LLM response
- The commit message extraction should look for the `<aider-commit-message>` XML tag in the LLM response
- The UI should make the relationship between these features clear to users
- The implementation should respect existing Git settings like dirty commits
