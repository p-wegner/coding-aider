# Tree Visualization Enhancement for Plan Viewer

## Overview
Improve the tree visualization of plans and subplans in the PlanViewer component to provide better hierarchical representation and user interaction.

## Problem Description
Current tree visualization in PlanViewer has several issues:
- Inconsistent indentation and tree line drawing
- Unclear parent-child relationships
- Suboptimal expand/collapse behavior
- Missing visual hierarchy indicators

## Goals
1. Implement proper tree structure visualization
2. Add clear visual connectors between parent and child plans
3. Improve expand/collapse functionality
4. Enhance visual hierarchy indicators
5. Maintain consistent indentation levels

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- Must support arbitrary nesting depth
- Should use standard tree view conventions (lines, arrows, etc)
- Need to handle both expanded and collapsed states properly
- Visual indicators should work in both light and dark themes
- Must maintain existing functionality while improving visualization
