# Improve AiderInputDialog Message Input

## Feature Description
Enhance the message input text area in the AiderInputDialog with rich IDE editor-like features, focusing on code completion and syntax highlighting. The initial implementation will provide filename suggestions from the context view when the user presses Ctrl + Space.

## Implementation Overview
1. Implement a basic code completion feature for filenames
2. Add syntax highlighting to the input text area
3. Enhance the code completion feature with more context-aware suggestions
4. Implement a more advanced text editor component

## Detailed Steps
1. Basic Code Completion for Filenames
   - Replace the JTextArea with a more capable text component (e.g., RSyntaxTextArea)
   - Implement a custom CompletionProvider for filenames
   - Set up a KeyStroke (Ctrl + Space) to trigger the completion popup
   - Populate the completion suggestions with filenames from the context view

2. Syntax Highlighting
   - Configure the RSyntaxTextArea with appropriate syntax highlighting for general text and code snippets
   - Implement custom TokenMakerFactory and TokenMaker for Aider-specific syntax if needed

3. Enhanced Code Completion
   - Extend the CompletionProvider to include more context-aware suggestions (e.g., Aider commands, common coding patterns)
   - Implement intelligent suggestion filtering based on the current input context

4. Advanced Text Editor Features
   - Investigate and implement additional features like code folding, line numbering, and bracket matching
   - Add support for multiple language syntax highlighting based on the context

## Notes
- Ensure backwards compatibility with existing AiderInputDialog functionality
- Consider performance implications, especially for large projects with many files in the context view
- Maintain a clean and intuitive user interface despite the added complexity
