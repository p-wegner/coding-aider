# [Coding Aider Plan] Markdown Renderer Fixes

## Overview
This plan addresses critical issues in the JcefMarkdownRenderer component and related classes as identified in the issues.md document. The fixes focus on lifecycle management, threading, JavaScript/HTML template improvements, performance optimizations, and UX enhancements to align with the PRD requirements.

## Problem Description
The current implementation of the JcefMarkdownRenderer has several issues:

1. **Lifecycle & Resource Management Issues**: Memory leaks, thread leaks, and improper disposal of resources.
2. **Threading/EDT Violations**: Heavy operations on the EDT, improper thread handling for Swing/CEF operations.
3. **JavaScript/HTML Template Defects**: Broken panel state persistence, security vulnerabilities in JS escaping, missing CSS.
4. **Performance Concerns**: Inefficient DOM updates, excessive object creation, and redundant processing.
5. **UX Gaps vs PRD**: Missing animations, incorrect auto-scroll behavior, and incomplete keyboard navigation.

These issues can lead to memory leaks, UI freezes, security vulnerabilities, and a suboptimal user experience.

## Goals
1. Fix all critical lifecycle and resource management issues to prevent memory leaks
2. Correct threading violations to ensure UI responsiveness
3. Improve JavaScript/HTML template for better security and functionality
4. Optimize performance for smoother operation with large documents
5. Enhance UX to fully align with PRD requirements

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- All fixes must maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Changes should follow IntelliJ Platform best practices
- Performance improvements should be measurable, especially for large documents
- Security fixes are high priority, especially for JS injection vulnerabilities
