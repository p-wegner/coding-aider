# [Coding Aider Plan] Markdown Viewer Component Refactoring

## Overview
This plan outlines a comprehensive refactoring of the MarkdownJcefViewer component to improve maintainability, reduce error-proneness, and ensure all requirements from the MarkdownViewerPRD are met. The current implementation has grown organically and contains several areas where code organization, separation of concerns, and error handling could be improved.

## Problem Description
The current MarkdownJcefViewer implementation has several issues:

1. **Monolithic Structure**: The class handles too many responsibilities including rendering, content processing, HTML generation, and event handling.
2. **Error-Prone JavaScript Integration**: The current approach to updating content via JavaScript is fragile and lacks proper error handling.
3. **Complex HTML/CSS Generation**: HTML and CSS are generated as string literals within the code, making them difficult to maintain.
4. **Insufficient Separation of Concerns**: Content processing, rendering, and styling are tightly coupled.
5. **Limited Testability**: The current structure makes unit testing difficult.
6. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Error handling is scattered and inconsistent throughout the code.
7. **Redundant Code**: There are several instances of code duplication.

## Goals
1. **Improve Code Organization**: Refactor the component into smaller, focused classes with clear responsibilities.
2. **Enhance Maintainability**: Make the code easier to understand, modify, and extend.
3. **Strengthen Error Handling**: Implement consistent, robust error handling throughout.
4. **Improve Testability**: Restructure the code to facilitate unit testing.
5. **Preserve Functionality**: Maintain all existing features as described in the MarkdownViewerPRD.
6. **Separate Concerns**: Clearly separate content processing, HTML generation, and rendering.
7. **Improve Resource Management**: Ensure proper cleanup of resources.

## Additional Notes and Constraints
1. **Backward Compatibility**: The refactored component must maintain the same public API to avoid breaking existing code.
2. **Performance Considerations**: The refactoring should not negatively impact rendering performance.
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: The fallback to JEditorPane when JCEF is unavailable must be preserved.
4. **Theme Integration**: The component must continue to adapt to IDE theme changes.
5. **Special Content Processing**: All special content processing (search/replace blocks, collapsible panels, etc.) must be maintained.
