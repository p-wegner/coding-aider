# Plan Sidecar Execution Integration

## Overview
Integrate plan-specific sidecar processes with the plan execution system.

## Problem Description
The current execution system needs to be modified to:
- Use plan-specific processes
- Maintain context between steps
- Handle process switching
- Support concurrent execution

## Goals
1. Update execution flow for plan sidecar mode
2. Integrate with process management
3. Handle context persistence
4. Support process switching
5. Manage concurrent execution

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Should handle process failures gracefully
- Must preserve existing execution modes
- Should optimize context switching
