[Coding Aider Plan]

# Plan Sidecar Mode Implementation

## Overview
Add a new execution mode that maintains a dedicated Aider sidecar process for each active plan, improving performance and context retention during plan execution.

## Problem Description
Currently, even in sidecar mode, the plugin uses a single Aider process for all commands. This means:
- Context and files need to be reloaded between plan continuation steps
- No persistent conversation history per plan
- Potential conflicts between concurrent plan executions
- Inefficient context switching between plans

## Goals
1. Create a plan-specific sidecar process management system
2. Maintain separate Aider processes for each active plan
3. Preserve context between plan continuation steps
4. Enable efficient plan switching without context reloading
5. Ensure proper cleanup of inactive plan processes

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- Must be configurable via settings (experimental feature)
- Should handle process lifecycle with plan completion
- Must work with both native and Docker execution modes
- Should maintain proper error handling and recovery
- Must clean up resources properly on plugin shutdown
- Should respect existing sidecar mode settings

## Implementation Strategy
The implementation will be split into two main components:

<!-- SUBPLAN:plan_sidecar_process_management -->
[Subplan: Process Management](plan_sidecar_process_management.md)
<!-- END_SUBPLAN -->

<!-- SUBPLAN:plan_sidecar_execution -->
[Subplan: Plan Execution Integration](plan_sidecar_execution.md)
<!-- END_SUBPLAN -->
