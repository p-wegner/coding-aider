# Plan Sidecar Process Management Implementation

## Overview
Implement a dedicated process management system for plan-specific Aider sidecar processes.

## Problem Description
The current sidecar implementation uses a single process for all operations. We need to:
- Track multiple concurrent Aider processes
- Associate processes with specific plans
- Handle process lifecycle events
- Manage resource cleanup

## Goals
1. Create a process registry system
2. Implement process lifecycle management
3. Handle process status monitoring
4. Ensure proper resource cleanup
5. Support concurrent plan execution

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- Must handle process crashes gracefully
- Should support process reuse when possible
- Must prevent resource leaks
- Should support monitoring process health
