[Coding Aider Plan]

## Overview
Integrate the plan creation functionality with existing systems in the Coding Aider plugin.

## Problem Description
The new plan creation feature needs to be properly integrated with existing components, including the command execution flow, UI components, and plan management systems.

## Goals
1. Connect UI triggers to plan creation logic
2. Integrate with command execution flow
3. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
4. Maintain compatibility with existing plan management

## Implementation Details
### UI Integration
- Connect dialog button click handler to plan creation logic
- Connect toolwindow button click handler to plan creation logic
- Implement progress indication during plan creation
- Provide success/failure feedback to user

### Command Execution Integration
- Store completed command data for later plan creation
- Ensure plan creation doesn't interfere with ongoing commands
- Handle plan creation timing relative to command completion

### Plan Management Integration
- Ensure created plans appear in plan management UI
- Integrate with existing plan navigation
- Maintain compatibility with plan execution flow

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- Avoid introducing circular dependencies
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Consider thread safety for asynchronous operations
- Ensure proper error handling throughout integration points
