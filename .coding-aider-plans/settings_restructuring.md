# [Coding Aider Plan] Settings Restructuring

## Overview
The Aider plugin settings have grown extensively over time, resulting in a cluttered and overwhelming configuration interface. This plan aims to reorganize the settings into logical groups, improve the UI layout, and refactor the underlying code to be more maintainable.

## Problem Description
Currently, the settings panel presents a large number of options without clear organization, making it difficult for new users to understand and configure the plugin effectively. The settings are displayed in a flat structure with minimal grouping, and the code that manages these settings lacks modularity.

Key issues:
1. Too many settings displayed at once without clear categorization
2. Lack of visual hierarchy to distinguish important vs. advanced settings
3. Settings code is not modular, making maintenance difficult
4. New users are overwhelmed when first opening the settings panel
5. Related settings are scattered throughout the interface

## Goals
1. Reorganize settings into logical, well-named groups
2. Create a tabbed interface to separate major setting categories
3. Improve the visual hierarchy of settings within each group
4. Refactor the settings code to be more modular and maintainable
5. Make the most common settings easily accessible
6. Hide advanced settings in appropriate collapsible sections
7. Improve tooltips and documentation for settings

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing saved settings
- Ensure all current functionality remains accessible
- Consider the user journey and common configuration patterns
- Focus on improving the initial user experience
- Maintain the existing settings service architecture
