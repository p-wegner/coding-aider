## Issues to Avoid

1. **Multiple Classes in a File**: In Kotlin, a single file can contain multiple classes. However, you only need to
   include one package declaration at the top of the file.

2. **Import Statements**: Ensure that all import statements are positioned at the very top of the file, preceding any
   declarations or definitions.
