# Output View Module Documentation

## Overview
The Output View module is responsible for displaying output in a user-friendly manner within the application. It provides a dialog interface for presenting markdown content and allows users to interact with ongoing processes, including the ability to abort commands.

## Key Classes

### Abortable
- **File:** [Abortable.kt](Abortable.kt)
- **Purpose:** This interface defines a contract for classes that can abort a command. It contains a single method:
  - `fun abortCommand()`: This method is called to abort the ongoing command.

### MarkdownDialog
- **File:** [MarkdownDialog.kt](MarkdownDialog.kt)
- **Purpose:** This class represents a dialog that displays markdown content. It allows users to view output and provides options to close or keep the dialog open.
- **Key Methods:**
  - `fun updateProgress(output: String, message: String)`: Updates the displayed output and title of the dialog.
  - `fun startAutoCloseTimer()`: Starts a timer that automatically closes the dialog after a specified delay.
  - `fun setProcessFinished()`: Marks the process as finished and updates the close button text.
  - `fun focus(delay: Long = 100)`: Brings the dialog to the front and requests focus.

## Design Patterns
The Output View module utilizes the **Observer** pattern through the `Abortable` interface, allowing different components to respond to abort commands.

## Dependencies
The Output View module depends on the following:
- **IntelliJ Platform SDK**: For UI components and project integration.
- **AiderSettings**: For retrieving user settings related to the markdown dialog.
