## AiderAction

`AiderAction` is the main action class for the Coding Aider plugin. It provides functionality to execute Aider commands
on selected files.

Key features:

- Supports both IDE-based and shell-based execution modes
- Uses `AiderInputDialog` for user input
- Handles persistent files
- Implements `ActionUpdateThread.BGT` for better performance

Exceptional implementation details:

- Supports a direct shell mode through the `AiderShellAction` subclass
- Uses a companion object to handle the main logic, allowing for easy reuse in other contexts
- Implements a flexible `executeAiderActionWithCommandData` method for custom command execution

- Optionally processes the markdown file further using an AI model
- Adds the processed file to persistent files

Exceptional implementation details:

- Uses MD5 hashing to generate unique filenames
- Implements a custom cleanup process using AI to simplify and structure the crawled content
- Provides user feedback through IDE notifications

## ApplyDesignPatternAction

`ApplyDesignPatternAction` allows users to apply design patterns to selected files or directories.

Key features:

- Presents a dialog for users to select and apply a predefined design pattern
- Loads design patterns from a YAML resource file

## FixCompileErrorAction

`FixCompileErrorAction` provides functionality to fix compile errors using Aider.

Key features:

- Supports both interactive and quick fix modes
- Implements intention actions for IDE integration
- Detects compile errors in the current file
- Provides a background task for the interactive mode to prevent UI freezing

Exceptional implementation details:

- Uses `DocumentMarkupModel` to detect compile errors
- Implements two separate intention actions for quick fix and interactive modes

## OpenAiderActionGroup

`OpenAiderActionGroup` provides a popup menu with all available Aider actions.

Key features:

- Creates a flat list of all Aider actions, including those in subgroups
- Displays the actions in a popup menu
- Supports action search functionality

## PersistentFilesAction

`PersistentFilesAction` manages the list of persistent files for Aider.

Key features:

- Toggles files between persistent and non-persistent states
- Provides visual feedback through notifications
- Supports bulk operations on multiple files and directories

Exceptional implementation details:

- Dynamically updates the action text based on the current state of selected files
- Refreshes the context file to ensure UI updates

## SettingsAction
