# Command Module Documentation

This module is part of the `de.andrena.codingaider.command` package and provides data structures for managing command execution within the Coding Aider system. It includes classes that encapsulate the necessary information for executing commands and handling file data.

## Overview

The module consists of two primary data classes:

1. **FileData**: Represents metadata about a file, including its path and read-only status.
2. **CommandData**: Encapsulates all the information required to execute a command, including message, language model, file list, and various flags.

### FileData Class

- **Purpose**: To store information about a file, specifically its path and whether it is read-only.
- **Attributes**:
  - `filePath`: A `String` representing the path to the file.
  - `isReadOnly`: A `Boolean` indicating if the file is read-only.

### CommandData Class

- **Purpose**: To encapsulate all necessary data for executing a command in the Coding Aider system.
- **Attributes**:
  - `message`: A `String` containing the main message or instruction for Aider.
  - `useYesFlag`: A `Boolean` that, if true, automatically confirms all prompts.
  - `llm`: A `String` specifying the language model to be used (e.g., "gpt-4").
  - `additionalArgs`: A `String` for any additional command-line arguments for Aider.
  - `files`: A `List<FileData>` representing the files to be included in the command.
  - `isShellMode`: A `Boolean` that, if true, enables shell mode for Aider.
  - `lintCmd`: A `String` specifying the command to run for linting the code.
  - `deactivateRepoMap`: A `Boolean` that, if true, disables the repository mapping feature.
  - `editFormat`: A `String` specifying the format for edit instructions (e.g., "diff").
  - `projectPath`: A `String` representing the path to the project.
  - `useDockerAider`: An optional `Boolean` indicating whether to use Docker for Aider.
  - `structuredMode`: A `Boolean` indicating if structured mode is enabled.

## Integration and Dependencies

- **Integration Points**: This module interacts with other parts of the Coding Aider system by providing structured data for command execution.
- **Dependencies**: Relies on Kotlin's standard library for data class functionality.

## Design Patterns

- Utilizes the data class pattern to encapsulate and manage data efficiently.

## Exceptional Implementation Details

- The `CommandData` class includes an optional `useDockerAider` attribute, which allows for flexibility in execution environments by optionally using Docker.
- The `deactivateRepoMap` attribute in `CommandData` provides a mechanism to disable repository mapping, which can be crucial for certain command executions.

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the module's purpose, functionality, and integration within the larger system. It is intended to assist developers and maintainers in understanding the module's role and usage.

## Key Classes and Methods

- **FileData**: A data class for file metadata.
- **CommandData**: A data class for command execution data.

## Module Role and Interaction

This module is crucial for managing command execution within the Coding Aider system. It provides structured data that other modules can use to execute commands effectively. The `CommandData` class, in particular, serves as a central point for gathering all necessary information for command execution, ensuring that all parameters are correctly set and passed to the execution engine.

## Public Interfaces

- **FileData**: Provides a simple interface for accessing file path and read-only status.
- **CommandData**: Offers a comprehensive interface for setting up command execution parameters.

## Data Flow and Integration

The module's data classes are designed to be integrated with the broader Coding Aider system, allowing for seamless command execution. The `CommandData` class, with its various attributes, ensures that all necessary data is available for executing commands, while the `FileData` class provides essential file metadata.

## Conclusion

This documentation serves as a guide for developers and maintainers to understand the `de.andrena.codingaider.command` module's functionality and integration within the Coding Aider system. By providing detailed information on the module's classes, attributes, and integration points, it aims to facilitate effective use and maintenance of the module.
