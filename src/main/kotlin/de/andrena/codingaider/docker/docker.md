# DockerContainerManager Module Documentation

## Overview

The `DockerContainerManager` class is responsible for managing Docker containers within the application. It provides functionality to retrieve the container ID from a temporary file, stop the running Docker container, and remove the associated container ID file. This module plays a crucial role in ensuring that Docker containers are properly managed and cleaned up, which is essential for maintaining a clean development environment.

## Key Classes and Methods

### DockerContainerManager

- **Properties:**
  - `logger`: An instance of `Logger` for logging messages.
  - `uniqueId`: A unique identifier for the instance, generated using `UUID`.
  - `cidFile`: A temporary file that stores the Docker container ID.
  - `dockerContainerId`: A nullable string that holds the current Docker container ID.

- **Public Methods:**
  - `getCidFilePath()`: Returns the absolute path of the CID file.
  - `stopDockerContainer()`: Stops the Docker container using the container ID retrieved from the CID file.
  - `removeCidFile()`: Deletes the CID file if it exists.

- **Private Methods:**
  - `getDockerContainerId()`: Attempts to read the Docker container ID from the CID file, retrying up to 10 times if necessary.

## Design Patterns

The `DockerContainerManager` class follows the Singleton pattern by ensuring that only one instance of the class is created and used throughout the application. This is achieved through the use of a unique identifier and the management of the Docker container lifecycle.

## Dependencies

The `DockerContainerManager` class depends on the following modules:
- `com.intellij.openapi.diagnostic.Logger`: For logging purposes.
- `java.io.File`: For file operations.
- `java.util.UUID`: For generating unique identifiers.
- `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit`: For managing time-related operations.

## Data Flow

1. The `DockerContainerManager` class initializes and creates a temporary file to store the Docker container ID.
2. The `getDockerContainerId()` method reads the container ID from the CID file, retrying if the file is not yet available.
3. The `stopDockerContainer()` method uses the retrieved container ID to stop the Docker container.
4. After stopping the container, the `removeCidFile()` method is called to clean up the temporary file.

## Integration Points

This module interacts with the Docker command-line interface to manage containers. It is essential for any functionality that requires Docker container management within the application.
