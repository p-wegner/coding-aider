# Module Documentation: PersistentFilesChangedTopic

## Overview
The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` module is part of the `de.andrena.codingaider.messages` package. It provides a mechanism for notifying subscribers about changes to persistent files within the system. This module plays a crucial role in ensuring that various components of the application can react to file changes, thereby maintaining synchronization and consistency across the application.

## Key Classes and Interfaces

### PersistentFilesChangedTopic
- **Interface**: `PersistentFilesChangedTopic`
  - **Method**: `fun onPersistentFilesChanged()`
    - This method is called to notify subscribers that persistent files have changed. Implementing classes should define the behavior that should occur when this event is triggered.

### Companion Object
- **Companion Object**: `companion object`
  - **Property**: `val PERSISTENT_FILES_CHANGED_TOPIC`
    - A static reference to the topic, which can be used to subscribe to or publish events related to persistent file changes.

## Design Patterns
This module utilizes the **Observer Pattern**. The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` interface allows multiple subscribers to listen for changes, promoting a decoupled architecture where components can react to events without being tightly integrated.

## Dependencies
This module may depend on the IntelliJ Platform's messaging system, specifically the `com.intellij.util.messages.Topic` class, which facilitates the topic-based event system.

## Data Flow
1. When a persistent file changes, the relevant component will invoke the `onPersistentFilesChanged()` method.
2. All subscribers that have registered for the `PERSISTENT_FILES_CHANGED_TOPIC` will receive the notification and can execute their respective logic in response to the change.

## Integration Points
This module interacts with other components that need to be informed about file changes, such as file editors, version control systems, or any other modules that manage persistent data.
