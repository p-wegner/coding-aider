# PersistentFilesChangedTopic Documentation

## Overview

The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` interface is part of the `de.andrena.codingaider.messages` package. It is designed to handle events related to changes in persistent files within the system. This interface is a key component in the event-driven architecture of the application, allowing different parts of the system to react to file changes.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of the `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` is to define a contract for handling persistent file change events. It provides a method, `onPersistentFilesChanged`, which is intended to be implemented by classes that need to respond to these events.

## Public Interface

- **Method: `onPersistentFilesChanged()`**
  - This method is called when there is a change in the persistent files. Implementers of this interface should define the specific actions to be taken when this event occurs.

## Key Classes and Methods

- **Interface: `PersistentFilesChangedTopic`**
  - Defines the method `onPersistentFilesChanged` for handling file change events.

- **Companion Object:**
  - `PERSISTENT_FILES_CHANGED_TOPIC`: A `Topic` instance that represents the event of persistent files changing. It is created using the `Topic.create` method, which is part of the IntelliJ Platform's messaging infrastructure.

## Design Patterns

The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` utilizes the Observer design pattern, where it acts as a subject that notifies observers (implementers of the interface) about changes in persistent files.

## Dependencies and Integration

- **Dependency:** `com.intellij.util.messages.Topic`
  - The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` relies on the `Topic` class from the IntelliJ Platform to create a messaging topic for file change events.

- **Integration Points:**
  - This interface is intended to be implemented by classes that need to respond to persistent file changes, allowing them to integrate seamlessly into the application's event-driven architecture.

## Exceptional Implementation Details

There are no exceptional implementation details for this interface. It follows standard practices for defining event-driven interfaces within the IntelliJ Platform.
