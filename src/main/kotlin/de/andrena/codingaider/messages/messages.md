# Messages Module Documentation

## Overview
The Messages module is responsible for handling events related to persistent file changes within the application. It provides a mechanism for components to subscribe to notifications when persistent files are modified.

## Key Classes and Interfaces

### PersistentFilesChangedTopic
- **Interface**: `PersistentFilesChangedTopic`
- **Method**: `onPersistentFilesChanged()`
  - This method is called when persistent files are changed. Implementing classes should define the behavior that occurs in response to this event.

#### Companion Object
- **PERSISTENT_FILES_CHANGED_TOPIC**: A static reference to the topic that can be used to publish and subscribe to persistent file change events.

## Design Patterns
The module utilizes the Observer design pattern, allowing multiple components to listen for changes in persistent files without tightly coupling them to the source of the changes.

## Dependencies
This module depends on the IntelliJ Platform's messaging system, specifically the `Topic` class, which facilitates the event-driven architecture.

## Data Flow
1. Components that need to respond to persistent file changes implement the `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` interface.
2. When a persistent file change occurs, the relevant method is invoked, notifying all subscribed components.
