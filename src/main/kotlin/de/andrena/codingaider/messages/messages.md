# PersistentFilesChangedTopic Documentation

## Overview

The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` interface is part of the `de.andrena.codingaider.messages` package. It is designed to handle events related to changes in persistent files within the system. This interface is a key component in the event-driven architecture of the application, allowing different parts of the system to react to file changes.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of the `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` is to define a contract for handling persistent file change events. It provides a method, `onPersistentFilesChanged`, which is intended to be implemented by classes that need to respond to these events.

## Key Components

- **Interface: PersistentFilesChangedTopic**
  - **Method: onPersistentFilesChanged()**
    - This method is called when there is a change in the persistent files. Implementers of this interface should define the specific actions to be taken when this event occurs.

- **Companion Object:**
  - **PERSISTENT_FILES_CHANGED_TOPIC**
    - A `Topic` instance created using IntelliJ's messaging infrastructure. It serves as a communication channel for broadcasting persistent file change events to interested subscribers.

## Design Patterns

The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` utilizes the Observer design pattern, where it acts as a subject that notifies observers (subscribers) about changes in persistent files. This pattern is implemented using IntelliJ's `Topic` class, which facilitates the publish-subscribe mechanism.

## Integration Points

This module integrates with IntelliJ's messaging system, allowing it to broadcast events to other components within the IDE. It is crucial for maintaining synchronization between the IDE's state and the underlying file system.

## Dependencies

- **IntelliJ Platform SDK:**
  - The `Topic` class from the IntelliJ Platform SDK is used to create the `PERSISTENT_FILES_CHANGED_TOPIC`.

## Conclusion

The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` is a vital part of the application's infrastructure for handling file change events. By defining a clear interface and leveraging IntelliJ's messaging system, it ensures that changes in persistent files are efficiently communicated across the system.

## Exceptional Implementation Details

The `PersistentFilesChangedTopic` interface is implemented using IntelliJ's messaging infrastructure, which is a robust and efficient way to handle inter-component communication within the IDE. The use of the `Topic` class allows for a decoupled architecture, where components can subscribe to events without needing direct references to each other. This design choice enhances the modularity and scalability of the application.
