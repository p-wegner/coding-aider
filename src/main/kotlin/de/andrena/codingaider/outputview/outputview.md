# Output View Module Documentation

This module provides classes and interfaces for managing output views in the Coding Aider application. It includes the `MarkdownDialog` class for displaying markdown content in a dialog and the `Abortable` interface for handling abort operations.

## Classes and Interfaces

### MarkdownDialog

- **Purpose**: Displays markdown content in a dialog window with options to auto-close or abort operations.
- **Key Features**:
  - Displays content in a non-editable `JTextArea` within a `JBScrollPane`.
  - Supports auto-closing with a timer, which can be canceled by the user.
  - Provides buttons for closing or aborting the dialog.
  - Updates the dialog's title and content dynamically.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes the Observer pattern with `invokeLater` for UI updates.
- **Dependencies**: Relies on `AiderSettings` for configuration settings like auto-close behavior.

### Abortable

- **Purpose**: Interface for defining abort operations.
- **Method**: `abortCommand()` - Implement this method to define custom abort behavior.

## Integration Points

- The `MarkdownDialog` interacts with the `AiderSettings` to determine auto-close settings.
- The `Abortable` interface is used by `MarkdownDialog` to handle abort operations, allowing for flexible integration with different command processes.

## Exceptional Implementation Details

- The `MarkdownDialog` uses a `Timer` to manage auto-close functionality, which is configurable through the `AiderSettings`.
- The dialog's `alwaysOnTop` property is toggled to ensure it gains focus when needed.

This module is crucial for providing a user-friendly interface for displaying and managing markdown content within the application, with flexible options for user interaction and process management.
