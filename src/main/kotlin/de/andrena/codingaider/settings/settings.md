# Aider Module Documentation

## Overview
The Aider module is designed to facilitate the integration of the Aider tool within an IDE environment. It manages project settings, default configurations, and command execution for the Aider tool, allowing users to customize their experience and streamline their workflow.

## Key Files

### [AiderDefaults.kt](AiderDefaults.kt)
This file contains default settings and constants used throughout the Aider module. It defines various configuration options such as whether to include open files, use structured mode, and settings related to Docker usage.

### [AiderSettings.kt](AiderSettings.kt)
This file manages the persistent state of the Aider settings. It implements the `PersistentStateComponent` interface, allowing settings to be saved and loaded from an XML file. Key properties include:
- `useYesFlag`: Indicates if the `--yes` flag should be used by default.
- `llm`: The default language model to be used.
- `dockerImageTag`: The Docker image tag for the Aider tool.

### [AiderTestCommand.kt](AiderTestCommand.kt)
This file defines the `AiderTestCommand` class, which is responsible for executing test commands for the Aider tool. It constructs a `CommandData` object and utilizes the `LiveUpdateExecutor` to run commands asynchronously, providing feedback through a `CommandObserver`.

### [AiderProjectSettings.kt](AiderProjectSettings.kt)
This file manages project-specific settings for Aider. It extends `PersistentStateComponent` to store and retrieve project settings, including a list of persistent files. The `AiderProjectSettings` class provides methods to get and set these files.

### [AiderSettingsConfigurable.kt](AiderSettingsConfigurable.kt)
This file provides a user interface for configuring Aider settings within the IDE. It implements the `Configurable` interface and allows users to modify settings such as API keys, Docker configurations, and other general settings.

### [AiderProjectSettingsConfigurable.kt](AiderProjectSettingsConfigurable.kt)
Similar to `AiderSettingsConfigurable`, this file provides a UI for managing project-specific settings. It allows users to add, remove, and toggle the read-only status of persistent files associated with the project.

## Design Patterns
The Aider module employs several design patterns:
- **Singleton Pattern**: Used in `AiderSettings` and `AiderProjectSettings` to ensure a single instance is used throughout the application.
- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented in `AiderTestCommand` to notify observers about command execution progress and results.

## Dependencies and Data Flow
The Aider module interacts with various components of the IDE and other modules. Below is a PlantUML diagram illustrating the dependencies:
