# Aider Module Documentation

## Overview
The Aider module provides functionalities for managing project settings and configurations related to the Aider tool. It includes default settings, project-specific settings, and user interface components for configuring these settings within an IDE.

## Key Classes and Interfaces

### AiderDefaults
- **Purpose**: Contains default values for various settings used in the Aider module.
- **Key Constants**:
  - `ALWAYS_INCLUDE_OPEN_FILES`: Boolean indicating whether to always include open files.
  - `USE_STRUCTURED_MODE`: Boolean indicating whether to use structured mode.
  - `DOCKER_IMAGE`: String representing the default Docker image for Aider.

### AiderSettings
- **Purpose**: Manages application-wide settings for Aider.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getState()`: Returns the current state of the settings.
  - `loadState(state: State)`: Loads the provided state into the settings.
- **Data Flow**: This class interacts with the application state and persists settings across sessions.

### AiderTestCommand
- **Purpose**: Executes a test command for Aider and notifies observers of the command's progress.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `execute(observer: CommandObserver?, useDockerAider: Boolean)`: Executes the command and notifies the observer.

### AiderProjectSettings
- **Purpose**: Manages project-specific settings for Aider.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getState()`: Returns the current state of the project settings.
  - `loadState(state: State)`: Loads the provided state into the project settings.

### AiderSettingsConfigurable
- **Purpose**: Provides a user interface for configuring Aider settings within the IDE.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `createComponent()`: Creates the UI component for settings configuration.
  - `apply()`: Applies the changes made in the UI to the settings.

### AiderProjectSettingsConfigurable
- **Purpose**: Provides a user interface for configuring project-specific settings for Aider.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `createComponent()`: Creates the UI component for project settings configuration.
  - `apply()`: Applies the changes made in the UI to the project settings.

## Design Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Used in `AiderSettings` and `AiderProjectSettings` to ensure a single instance of settings is used throughout the application.

## Dependencies
- The Aider module depends on the IntelliJ Platform SDK for UI components and project management.
- It interacts with other modules that handle command execution and file management.

## Data Flow
- The settings are loaded and saved using the `PersistentStateComponent` interface, allowing for seamless integration with the IDE's settings management.
- User interactions with the UI components trigger updates to the settings, which are then persisted.
