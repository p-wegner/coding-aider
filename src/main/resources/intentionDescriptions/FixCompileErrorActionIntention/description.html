Fixes compile errors in the current file using AI-powered suggestions.
<p>
    This intention uses Aider, an AI-powered coding assistant, to automatically fix compile errors in your code. It analyzes the error messages and suggests corrections without requiring user interaction.
</p>
<p>
    When you apply this intention, Aider will:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analyze the compile errors in your file</li>
    <li>Generate a fix based on the error messages</li>
    <li>Apply the suggested changes to your code</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is useful for quickly resolving simple compile errors without manual intervention.

    Note: The effectiveness of the fix depends on the complexity of the error and the AI model's capabilities. Always review the changes made by the AI assistant.
