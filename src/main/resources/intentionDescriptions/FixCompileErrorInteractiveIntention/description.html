Interactively fixes compile errors in the current file using AI-powered suggestions.
<p>
    This intention uses Aider, an AI-powered coding assistant, to help fix compile errors in your code. It provides an interactive dialog where you can customize the fix request before applying changes.
</p>
<p>
    When you apply this intention, you'll be presented with a dialog where you can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>View the current compile errors</li>
    <li>Modify the fix request message</li>
    <li>Choose additional files to include in the context</li>
    <li>Select the AI model and adjust other Aider settings</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This interactive approach gives you more control over how Aider addresses the compile errors in your code.
</p>

<p>
    Note: The effectiveness of the fix depends on the complexity of the error, the AI model's capabilities, and the clarity of your instructions. Always review the changes suggested by the AI assistant.
