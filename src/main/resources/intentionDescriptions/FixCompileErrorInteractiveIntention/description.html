<ul>
    <li>Customizable input: Modify the default error message or add specific instructions.</li>
    <li>LLM selection: Choose between different language models for the task.</li>
    <li>Additional arguments: Fine-tune the Aider command with extra parameters.</li>
    <li>File selection: Include or exclude files from the fix scope.</li>
    <li>Shell mode: Toggle between normal and shell mode for advanced users.</li>
</ul>
