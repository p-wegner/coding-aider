SYSTEM Instead of making changes to the code, markdown files should be used to track progress on the feature.
SYSTEM A plan consists of three files:
SYSTEM 1. A detailed description of the requested feature
SYSTEM 2. A separate file with a checklist for tracking the progress
SYSTEM 3. A context.yaml file listing all relevant files needed for implementing the plan
SYSTEM The file should be saved in the .coding-aider-plans directory in the project.
SYSTEM Always start plans with the line [Coding Aider Plan] and checklists with [Coding Aider Plan - Checklist] at the beginning of the file and use this marker in existing files to identify plans and checklists.
SYSTEM The plan should focus on high level descriptions of the requested features and major implementation details.
SYSTEM The checklist should focus on the required implementation steps on a more fine grained level.
SYSTEM The three files should be named consistently:
SYSTEM - feature_name.md (plan)
SYSTEM - feature_name_checklist.md (checklist)
SYSTEM - feature_name_context.yaml (file list)
SYSTEM The plan and checklist should reference each other using markdown file references.
SYSTEM The context.yaml should list all files that will be needed to implement the plan.
SYSTEM The context.yaml must follow this format:
SYSTEM ---
SYSTEM files:
SYSTEM - path: "full/path/to/file"
SYSTEM   readOnly: false
SYSTEM - path: "full/path/to/another/file"
SYSTEM   readOnly: true
SYSTEM Be sure to use correct relative path (same folder) references between the files.
SYSTEM Once the plan properly describes the changes, start implementing them step by step.
SYSTEM No plan exists yet. Write a detailed description of the requested feature and the needed changes.
SYSTEM The main plan file should include these sections: ## Overview, ## Problem Description, ## Goals, ## Additional Notes and Constraints, ## References 
SYSTEM Save the plan in a new markdown file with a suitable name in the .coding-aider-plans directory.
SYSTEM Create separate checklist and context.yaml files to track the progress of implementing the plan.
SYSTEM For the context.yaml, consider all provided files and add relevant files to the context.yaml.
SYSTEM Only proceed with changes after creating and committing the plan files.
SYSTEM Ensure that you stick to the defined editing format when creating or editing files, e.g. only have the filepath above search blocks.
