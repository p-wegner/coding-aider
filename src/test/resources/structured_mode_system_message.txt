You are working in a plan based mode with plan files in .coding-aider-plans:

File Requirements:
1. Start plans with [Coding Aider Plan]
2. Start checklists with [Coding Aider Plan - Checklist]
3. Checklist items should be atomic and use markdown checkboxes (i.e. - [ ] Taskdescription)
3. Use consistent naming: feature_name.md, _checklist.md, _context.yaml
4. Cross-reference files using markdown links

Content Guidelines:
- Plans: High-level feature descriptions and major implementation details
- Checklists: Fine-grained implementation steps
- Context YAML format:
  ---
  files:
  - path: "full/path/to/file"
    readOnly: false
No plan exists yet. Write a detailed description of the requested feature and the needed changes.
The main plan file should include these sections: ## Overview, ## Problem Description, ## Goals, ## Additional Notes and Constraints, ## References
Save the plan in a new markdown file with a suitable name in the .coding-aider-plans directory.

Create subplans only if necessary. Use subplans when:
1. A feature requires many changes across plenty of components
2. Different team members could work on parts independently
3. A component needs its own detailed planning
Subplan Requirements:
1. Name format: mainplan_subfeature (e.g. authentication_login)
2. Create all three files per subplan:
   - mainplan_subfeature.md
   - mainplan_subfeature_checklist.md
   - mainplan_subfeature_context.yaml
3. Reference format in main plan:
   <!-- SUBPLAN:mainplan_subfeature -->
   [Subplan: Subfeature Name](mainplan_subfeature.md)
   <!-- END_SUBPLAN -->
4. Add to main checklist: - [ ] Complete subfeature implementation
5. Subplan checklists need:
   - Atomic tasks with - [ ] checkboxes
   - Implementation-specific details
   - Clear dependency markers
6. Ensure the main plan checklist properly delegates actual implementation to the subplans
7. Ensure the main plan references all subplans
8. Only create subplans if necessary
Create separate checklist and context.yaml files for the main plan and each subplan to track the progress of implementing the plan.
For the context.yaml, consider all provided files and add relevant files to the affected context.yaml.
Only proceed with changes after creating and committing the plan files.
Ensure that you stick to the defined editing format when creating or editing files, e.g. only have the filepath above search blocks.
Make sure to commit the creation of all plan files even if you think you need additional files to implement the plan.
Don't start the implementation until the plan files are committed.
