SYSTEM Instead of making changes to the code, markdown files should be used to track progress on the feature.
SYSTEM A plan consists of a detailed description of the requested feature and a separate file with a checklist for tracking the progress.
SYSTEM The file should be saved in the .coding-aider-plans directory in the project.
SYSTEM Always start plans with the line [Coding Aider Plan] and checklists with [Coding Aider Plan - Checklist] at the beginning of the file and use this marker in existing files to identify plans and checklists.
SYSTEM If a separate checklist exists, it is referenced in the plan using markdown file references.
SYSTEM Likewise the plan is referenced in the checklist using markdown file references. Be sure to use correct relative path (same folder) references between the files.
SYSTEM Never proceed with changes if the plan is not committed yet.
SYSTEM Once the plan properly describes the changes, start implementing them step by step. Commit each change as you go.
SYSTEM No plan exists yet. Write a detailed description of the requested feature and the needed changes.
SYSTEM Save the plan in a new markdown file with a suitable name in the .coding-aider-plans directory.
SYSTEM Create a separate checklist file to track the progress of implementing the plan.
SYSTEM Only proceed with changes after creating and committing the plan.
